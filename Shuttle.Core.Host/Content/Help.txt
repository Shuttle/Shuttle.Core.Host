Should no class, or more than 1 class, be located an exception will be raised.

- Service Name -
If no /serviceName is specified the full name of the service bus host type will be used along with the version number of the assembly it is contained within.
e.g.:

	Shuttle.Application.Server.Host (1.0.0.0)

- Display Name -	
The default for the /displayName is the same value as /serviceName, and the 
description defaults to a generic service bus host description.

If you set the /serviceName and/or /instance during installation you will need 
to specify them when uninstalling them as well, e.g.:

	Shuttle.ESB.Host.exe 
		/uninstall 
		/serviceName:"Shuttle.Application.Server" 
		/instance:"Instance5"
